To be included on the SFArts.org website, events must meet the following criteria:

<li>Events must be open to the general public.  Events such as camps, conferences, artist workshops or benefit fundraisers are not listed.</li>
<li>Events must be arts-related and fall into one of the following categories: Dance, Film/Video, Literary, Music, Theater, Museum, Gallery, Special Events/Festivals, Children's Events, Nightlife</li>
<li>Events must be held within our geographical area. Northern boundary is Sonoma, southern San Jose, eastern Walnut Creek, western San Francisco.</li>
<li>If there are numerous supporting events associated with a larger event, e.g., a lecture related to a museum exhibition, SFArts.org reserves the right to refer the site visitor to an organization's website for further information.</li>
<li>Event descriptions must be succinct; SFArts.org reserves the right to edit material that is submitted. If there is a factual error on the site, please notify us and it will be corrected as soon as possible. Otherwise, once the information is posted, it is final (with the exception of TBAs and unanticipated schedule changes, which will be posted as soon as possible after we are given updated information).</li>
<li>Because the SFArts.org database has a complex and specific structure, determinations must be made about how to list an event. Listings will be made according to how the public will most likely search for events.</li>
<li>We only list events in venues whose primary purpose is arts-related. For example, we do not list art shows in cafes, hair salons or boutiques.</li>
